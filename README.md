# printf Project

## Description
This project is an implementation of the `printf` function in C. The `printf` function is used to format and print data in various ways.

## Features
- Support for common format specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, etc.
- Ability to format and print integers, strings, characters, and more.
- Error handling for incorrect format strings.

## Usage
To use the `printf` function in your C program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `printf.c` file along with your program's source code.
3. Include the `printf.h` header in your code.
4. Use the `my_printf` function just like you would use `printf`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "printf.h"

int main() {
    my_printf("Hello, %s! Your score is %d.\n", "Ibk$chi", 200);
    return 0;
}
